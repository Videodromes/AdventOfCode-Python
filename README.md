# Advent of Code
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/about) is an Advent calendar of
small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can
be solved in any programming language. To save Christmas, you must collect fifty
stars (⭐) by December 25th. Stars are earned by solving puzzles; there are two
puzzles per day in the Advent calendar with the second puzzle unlocking after 
completion of the first. To prepare for the 2024 Advent of Code, I will be attempting
puzzles from past [events](https://adventofcode.com/events).

## Input Files
Input files are not included in this repo in respect of the copyright held by
Advent of Code. If you would like to test my solutions yourself, you must provide
your own test input. For example, you can grab your unique puzzle input from the
